# Transient-Stability-Assessment
Calculation of Maximum Transferable Power in an SMIB Network Based on Voltage Limitation at the Receiving End.

1. Plot of maximum power variations based on different values of end-of-line voltage.
2. Plot of maximum power variations based on different values of line reactance.
